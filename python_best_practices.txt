+ Variables
+============
  Use underscore to separate words in a variable name. For example, "customer_info" (better) versus "customerinfo". ( Using underscores typically improves clarity in variable naming in programming.)
  Use all capital letters in its name to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed  (Example MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5 )
  List variable names should be plural (e.g., items, stores, dates) since they are intended for groups of things.
