  Include a when / who / what change history banner at the top of each program.
  Document any approach used that was chosen over other alternatives and why it was chosen.

+ Variables
+============
  Use underscore to separate words in a variable name. For example, "customer_info" (better) versus "customerinfo". ( Using underscores typically improves clarity in variable naming in programming.)
  Use all capital letters in its name to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed  (Example MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5 )
  List variable names should be plural (e.g., items, stores, dates) since they are intended for groups of things.
  For the temporary variable in a for loop that will be associated with each value in the list use a meaningful name that represents a single item from the list. Example: for dog in dogs:

+ IDE / code editor
+===================
 - Configure your editor so it always inserts four spaces each time you press the TAB key.
 - Configure your editor so it shows a vertical guideline to help you follow the 79-character limit. (My preference is two rulers, one at 70 and another at 80.)
