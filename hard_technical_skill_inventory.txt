A skill set refers to a combination of skills, abilities, knowledge, and competencies that an individual possesses. It encompasses both hard skills (specific, teachable abilities or knowledge sets) and soft skills (interpersonal or people skills, such as communication and teamwork). 

Types of Skills in a Skill Set:
Hard Skills: These are technical skills that are often quantifiable and can typically be learned through formal education, training, or practice. Examples include:

Programming languages (e.g., Python, Java)
Data analysis (e.g., Excel, SQL)
Graphic design (e.g., Adobe Photoshop)
Language proficiency (e.g., spoken languages)
Soft Skills: These are interpersonal skills that relate to how a person interacts with others and handles situations. Examples include:

Importance of a Skill Set:
